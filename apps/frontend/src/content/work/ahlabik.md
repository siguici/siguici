## Ahlabik Tunisia

> Co-Founder & CTO

Since co-founding [Ahlabik.TN](https://ahlabik.tn/) in March 2020,
I have played a pivotal role in the platform’s development,
initially as the sole developer responsible
for implementing features and deploying solutions.
Now, as CTO, I oversee the platform’s continuous evolution and ensure
its robust technical architecture meets the needs of our users.

### Technologies and Architecture

Built with the TALL stack (TailwindCSS, Alpine.js, Laravel, Livewire),
leveraging Laravel’s flexibility to deliver a seamless and interactive user experience.

Backend functionality is implemented with PHP and TypeScript,
ensuring a secure and efficient experience for end users.

PostgreSQL powers our data layer, providing advanced performance, scalability,
and data integrity for a growing user base.

Continuous integration and deployment are managed on an Ubuntu-based VPS using Git
for version control and Docker for containerized, efficient application delivery.

#### Key Features

- An intuitive product management system allows partners
to list, update, and monitor their products,
enabling a streamlined multi-vendor environment.

- A smooth and interactive interface for customers,
with dynamic components built using Alpine.js and Livewire,
creating a responsive shopping experience.

#### Impact & Vision

Ahlabik.TN is actively evolving to meet the demands of the Tunisian e-commerce market.
As CTO, I ensure the platform remains technologically advanced and user-centric,
continuously enhancing our offering to better serve our community.
