## Melanoderme

> Full-Stack Developer & DevOps

I developed the [Melanoderme e-commerce platform](https://melanoderme.com) from the ground up,
building a comprehensive solution for showcasing products, managing deliveries,
and enabling a multi-vendor setup for other users to sell through the site.

### Technologies and Architecture

Developed with the TALL stack (TailwindCSS, Alpine.js, Laravel, Livewire)
to create a highly interactive, user-friendly shopping experience.

Built with PostgreSQL for powerful and reliable data management,
ensuring scalability as the platform grows.

I handled the platform’s deployment on a VPS, overseeing server management
to ensure high availability and performance.

#### Key Features

The platform allows Melanoderme to display its collection,
while also offering other users the ability to list their own products,
creating a vibrant multi-vendor marketplace.

Administrators can manage orders, track deliveries,
and maintain smooth logistics to enhance the customer experience.

Built with TailwindCSS and Alpine.js, the site is fully responsive,
ensuring a seamless shopping experience across devices.

#### Impact & Vision

- This platform has enabled Melanoderme to reach a wider audience
and grow their brand while also fostering a community for other sellers.

- The platform is designed to scale as the business expands,
supporting the brand’s mission to celebrate and share cultural identity through fashion.
