## Integration of Qwik Framework in Astro

> Core Maintainer & Contributor

As a principal maintainer and contributor
to the [QwikDev/Astro](https://github.com/QwikDev/astro) project, I work alongside
the [@QwikDev](https://github.com/QwikDev) team within the Astro ecosystem.
Initially contributing by fixing bugs, I advanced to implementing improvements,
writing unit and end-to-end (E2E) tests, and enhancing the library's robustness.

### Technologies and Contributions

Introduced comprehensive unit and E2E tests to ensure reliability
across different environments, which has contributed to improved code quality
and user confidence in the package.

Developed significant features, including template support without adapters,
and templates for server adapters like Deno and Node.js.

Implemented a command-line interface (`npm create qwikdev/astro`)
that allows users to rapidly scaffold new Astro projects integrated with Qwik,
improving developer experience and accessibility.

### Impact & Vision

- My contributions aim to streamline and solidify the integration
of Qwik within the Astro ecosystem, making it easier for developers
to harness the strengths of both frameworks for scalable,
performant web applications. As an active maintainer,

- I continue to drive the projectâ€™s growth and usability,
contributing to the future of web development with Qwik and Astro.
