## Punic Development Company

> Full-Stack Developer

Leveraging the TALL stack (TailwindCSS, Alpine.js, Laravel, Livewire)
and a MySQL database, I created a comprehensive job application management platform
to streamline the hiring process for [PDC](http://pdc.com.tn)’s partners.

### Technologies and Architecture

Built with the TALL stack to deliver a responsive, interactive user experience
and facilitate fast, scalable web development.

MySQL was chosen for data management, offering reliability
and seamless integration with Laravel’s Eloquent ORM.

The platform dynamically generates a printable PDF of each applicant’s CV,
making profiles readily accessible to administrators.

The site was deployed on a dedicated server,
ensuring optimized performance and security.

#### Key Features

Applicants register and input their CV details directly on the platform.
The system generates a formatted, downloadable CV for administrators,
saving both applicants and recruiters time.

Administrators can filter applications by job position,
enabling efficient candidate tracking and recruitment.

The platform includes a search tool that allows administrators
to quickly locate specific profiles, making the hiring process faster and more streamlined.

#### Impact & Vision

- This platform has optimized the recruitment process for PDC’s partners
by centralizing applications and simplifying candidate management.

- By providing automated, well-organized access to applicant profiles,
PDC’s platform supports more effective and data-driven hiring decisions.
