## Abi.js – Web Framework

> Lead Developer & Architect

I am currently developing [Abi.js](https://abi.js.org) with the goal of creating a versatile framework
that simplifies the process of building web applications,
command-line interfaces (CLIs), APIs, and more.

With a focus on cross-platform compatibility, Abi.js enables developers
to switch environments without the need to alter their codebase.

### Core Features

Designed to work flawlessly on Node.js, Deno, and Bun, Abi.js ensures
that developers can build applications without being tied to a specific runtime.

The framework emphasizes simplicity, providing an intuitive API
that facilitates rapid development and deployment.

Abi.js integrates PWA capabilities, allowing developers to create modern,
offline-capable web applications that enhance user engagement.

The framework supports SPA development while offering server-side pre-rendering
for improved performance and SEO.

### Vision and Impact

Abi.js aims to revolutionize the development experience by breaking down barriers between environments, allowing developers to focus on building exceptional applications without worrying about compatibility issues. With a strong commitment to simplicity and a broad feature set, Abi.js aspires to become a leading choice for developers seeking a robust yet uncomplicated framework.
